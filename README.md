# Pitch The Widget

The “Today’s Student Hub” widget solves the problem of students wasting time checking multiple apps and websites just to know what’s due, when their classes are, and if campus services are open. The “Today’s Student Hub” is a tailored widget which displays assignments due today and tomorrow, the day’s class schedule with times and rooms, and quick info for dining hall hours, gym hours, and tutoring/office hours all in one “hub”. A focus mode lets students hide everything except their next class and assignment. By putting all of this into one clean, color-coded view, the widget saves students time, reduces stress, and makes it easier to stay productive and focused throughout the day.
